This section explains some of the theory behind time-explicit transition pathway optimizations with `optimex`. In contrast to the [Getting Started section](getting_started/index.md), we explain a bit more of what`s going on in the background here. If this is still too vague for you, you can always check out our [API reference](api/index).
