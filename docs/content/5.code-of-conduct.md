# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

See the full [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RWTH-LTT/optimex/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) on GitHub.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement:

- Timo Diepers ([timo.diepers@ltt.rwth-aachen.de](mailto:timo.diepers@ltt.rwth-aachen.de))
- Jan Tautorus ([jan.tautorus@rwth-aachen.de](mailto:jan.tautorus@rwth-aachen.de))

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
