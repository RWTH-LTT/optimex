#title
Time-explicit Transition Pathway Optimization

#description
optimex helps identify optimal process portfolios and deployment timing in systems with multiple processes producing the same product, aiming to minimize dynamically accumulating environmental impacts over time.

  Life Cycle Timing
  #description
  The processes within a product's life cycle occur in sequence rather than all at once: production comes first, the use phase and end-of-life follow. optimex captures this by distributing process inputs and outputs over time.

  Technology Evolution
  #description
  In the future, processes will (hopefully) reduce their emissions. The time at which a process happens affects its impacts, with later occurrence often resulting in lower emissions. optimex reflects this by allowing process inventories to change over time.

  Emission Accumulation
  #description
  Most impacts come from emission accumulation, but are typically modeled as separate pulses. Emission timing affects how they accumulate, influencing environmental impacts. optimex considers the emission timing, enabling characterization via dynamic LCIA.

## About

`optimex` is a Python package for transition pathway optimization based on time-explicit Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It builds on top of the optimization framework [pyomo](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo) and the LCA framework [Brightway](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest).

During the transition pathway optimization, `optimex` simultaneously accounts for temporal considerations in environmental impacts, identifying the environmentally optimal process deployment over the transition period.
