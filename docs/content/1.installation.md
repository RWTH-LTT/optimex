# Installation

`optimex` is a Python software package. It's available via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) / [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

## Installing optimex using conda or mamba

::alert{type="warning"}
**Prerequisites**
1. A working installation of [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). If you are using `conda`, we recommend installing the [libmamba solver](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community).
2. Basic knowledge of [Conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
::

::code-group

```bash [Linux, Windows, macOS (x64)]
# Create a new Conda environment
conda create -n optimex -c conda-forge -c cmutel -c diepers optimex

# Activate the environment
conda activate optimex

# (Optional) Install useful libraries like jupyterlab
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

```bash [macOS (Apple Silicon/ARM)]
# Create a new Conda environment
conda create -n optimex -c conda-forge -c cmutel -c diepers optimex brightway25_nosolver scikit-umfpack numpy"<1.25"

# Activate the environment
conda activate optimex

# (Optional) Install useful libraries like jupyterlab
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

::alert{type="info"}
**Note for macOS Apple Silicon users:** Brightway runs on the new Apple Silicon ARM architecture. However, the super-fast linear algebra software library `pypardiso` is not compatible with the ARM processor architecture. To avoid critical errors, a different version of Brightway (`brightway25_nosolver`) and a different linear algebra software library (`scikit-umfpack`) must be installed.

## Installing optimex using pip

::code-group

```bash [Linux, Windows, macOS (x64)]
# Install Python from the website, your system package manager, or Homebrew

# Create a directory for virtual environments
mkdir -p ~/virtualenvs

# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv ~/virtualenvs/optimex

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source ~/virtualenvs/optimex/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
# ~/virtualenvs/optimex/Scripts/activate

# Install optimex
pip install optimex pypardiso
```

```bash [macOS (Apple Silicon/ARM)]
# Install Python from the website, your system package manager, or Homebrew

# Create a directory for virtual environments
cd
mkdir virtualenvs

# Create and activate a virtualenv
python -m venv virtualenvs/optimex
source virtualenvs/optimex/bin/activate

# Install optimex
pip install optimex
```

::alert{type="info"}
**Note for macOS Apple Silicon pip users:** Due to [an upstream bug](https://github.com/scikit-umfpack/scikit-umfpack/issues/98), there is currently no reliable way to install the fast sparse library `umfpack` on Apple Silicon using `pip`, and the `pypardiso` library is only for x64 systems. If you are doing computationally-intensive workflows, we recommend installing Brightway using `conda` or `mamba` for now. If you are doing fewer calculations or software development, installation via `pip` is fine.
