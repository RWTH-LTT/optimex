In this example, we use data from ecoinvent v3.10, and create a set of prospective databases with [premise](https://github.com/polca/premise). We applied projections for the future electricity sectors using the SSP2-RCP19 pathway from the IAM IMAGE. We selected this pathway to simply demonstrate some future development in this case study, and many other models and pathways are available. In the premise documentation you can find instructions for the creation of prospective background databases."
