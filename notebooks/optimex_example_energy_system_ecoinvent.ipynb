We applied projections for the future electricity sectors using the SSP2-RCP19 pathway from the IAM IMAGE. We selected this pathway to simply demonstrate some future development in this case study, and many other models and pathways are available. In the premise documentation you can find instructions for the creation of prospective background databases."

    "\n",
    "To organize the timing of flows (like resources or emissions) in a process, we divide them into three life cycle stages: **construction, operation, decomission**\n",
    "\n",
    "For every flow in a process, we assign it to one of these stages based on its context. For example:\n",
    "- Materials and energy used during setup belong to the **construction** stage.\n",
    "- Emissions or resource use during active operation go into the **operation** stage.\n",
    "- End-of-life impacts, such as waste from dismantling, belong to the **decommissioning** stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use specific distributions to spread the impacts of each flow across its corresponding stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Construction**: A **triangular distribution** is applied, which means the flow is concentrated more heavily around a central peak but still allows for earlier and later occurrences.\n",
    "- **Operation**: A **uniform distribution** is used, assuming the impacts are evenly spread over the entire operational lifetime.\n",
    "- **Decommissioning**: Typically, this stage occurs at the end of the process lifetime, so impacts are concentrated there.\n",
