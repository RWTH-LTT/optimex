    "\n",
    "1. **Time Alignment Dependency**:\n",
    "   - $A_{p,i,\\tau}$ and $B_{p,e,\\tau}$ depend on $\\tau$, while $S_{p, t-\\tau}$ transforms them into time-aligned terms ($\\hat{A}_{p,i,t}$ and $\\hat{B}_{p,e,t}$). This transformation is inherently tied to the structure of $S$, and there is no way to separate $S$ from these terms.\n",

    "   - Although the equation is linear in $S$, the summation over $\\tau$ introduces a dependency that prevents $S$ from being isolated. Each term $S_{p, t-\\tau}$ contributes uniquely to the transformed terms, making it impossible to extract $S$ globally.\n",
